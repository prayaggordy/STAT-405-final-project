## Data

See the appendix for details about each dataset's included variables.

### `census_county` and `census_region`

We used the `tidycensus` package in R to obtain American Community Survey 5-year data for the 2014-2019 span. The ACS is an annual survey that still collect large amounts of data from every single county in the US, so the data is more recent than the 2010 census and is still very comprehensive (2020 census data is not publicly available yet). We called two different data sets with different geographies: For one set, we got all the desired variables by county, while for the other set, we called the variables by region.

### Daily Covid counts

We collected `r length(unique(covid$date))` days' worth of Covid data—cases and deaths—from the New York Times. These data are at the county level. Some counties, such as those in Washington State where Covid was first recorded in the US, report cases as early as January; others only start reporting in March and beyond.

### Presidential Election Results by County

This dataset gives the number of votes cast for the major Democratic and Republican candidates for 2016 in 2020, along with the total number of votes cast, for each U.S. county. It was taken from the MIT Election Data and Science Lab's County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2020 dataset by filtering the year.

### Main Vaccination Dataset

We collected county-level vaccination data from the CDC's COVID-19 Data Tracker. Texas does not report county-level vaccination information to the CDC COVID-19 Data Tracker, and California does not report information for counties with fewer than 20,000 residents. All other US counties are included in this dataset. The dataset also contains county Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) information (see appendix for details).

### Texas Vaccination
To complete our county-level vaccination data, we collected vaccination data from the Texas Department of Health and Human services COVID-19 Vaccination in Texas Summary.

### Small California Counties Vaccination
To complete our county-level vaccination data, we obtained the total number of people vaccinated and the total number of people who have received at least one dose from all counties in California with fewer than 20,000 residents from [democratandchronicle.com](democratandchronicle.com).

### Vaccine Hesitancy
We obtained county-level estimates of the percentage of the population who is hesitant to receive the COVID-19 vaccine from the CDC (see appendix for details). The dataset also includes racial demographics and SVI (Social Vulnerability Index) information (see appendix for details), as well as geographical information because it was designed to produce a map.
