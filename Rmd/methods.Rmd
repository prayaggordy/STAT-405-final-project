## Methods
Note: This is an outline of our methods section.

* Linear regression to find predictors of vaccine hesitancy, specifically race and partisanship
* Linear regression to find predictors of vaccination rate, specifically race, partisanship, vaccine hesitancy, and other demographics (e.g. income)
	* Together, this can suggest whether vaccine hesitancy is a mediator, moderator, or neither
* Linear regression to examine relationship between vaccination rate and cumulative deaths, controlling for race and partisanship
	* This can shed light on whether the severity of the pandemic in a county influences residents' desire to get vaccinated
	

### t test for SVI data

```{r}
d <- get_vuln_not_vuln()
test <- t.test(unlist(d$vuln), unlist(d$not_vuln), alternative = 'less')

get_kable(test)
```
