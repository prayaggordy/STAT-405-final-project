## Introduction

Chattahoochee County, Georgia has reported that 99.9% of their population is vaccinated against COVID-19, according to the CDC, while other counties continue to report alarming single-digit vaccination percentages. Over 600,000 Americans have died due to COVID-19. Fully vaccinated people accounted for less than 1% of all US COVID-19 deaths in May and close to the same percent of all hospitalizations, meaning that almost all current and future US COVID-19 deaths are entirely preventable. Therefore, it is self-evidently in the interest of public health to understand what factors contribute to ongoing vaccination disparities between US counties. Our investigation seeks to address this broad question by exploring the relationships between county-level vaccination and COVID-19 cases and deaths in relation to variables like politics, race, and vaccine hesitancy.
