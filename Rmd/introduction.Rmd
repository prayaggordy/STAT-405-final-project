## Introduction

Chattahoochee County, Georgia has reported that 99.9% of their population is vaccinated against COVID-19, according to the CDC, while other counties continue to report alarming single-digit vaccination percentages. Over 600,000 Americans have died due to COVID-19. Fully vaccinated people accounted for less than 1% of all US COVID-19 deaths in May and close to the same percent of all hospitalizations, meaning that almost all current and future US COVID-19 deaths are entirely preventable. Therefore, it is self-evidently in the interest of public health to understand what factors contribute to ongoing vaccination disparities between US counties. Our investigation seeks to address this broad question by exploring the relationships between county-level vaccination and COVID-19 cases and deaths in relation to variables like politics, race, and vaccine hesitancy. 

### Our Motivation

It has been almost 18 months since COVID-19 reached the United States, and despite the massive economic, social, and human capital tolls of the pandemic, vaccination rates in the US remain too low to prevent the continual spread of the disease and its variants. In fact, cases are once again on the rise as the highly transmissible Delta variant continues to spread quickly throughout large pockets of the country. Given our mutual interests in exploring this issue, we decided to examine what some influencing factors might be for the low vaccination rates in much the country. We chose to analyze various factors, including geography and region, race, vulnerability, and politics.
